Computing exact 2D/3D Partition Functions
===================

This repo contains my source code for computing exact partition functions on 2 and 3 dimensional lattices. 

Firstly: a warning on the code... this was written before I read Robert Martin's. Clean Code and any experience working as a Software Developer. So expect a mess, there are no unit or integration tests. My testing was based on writing a brute force code to calculate results of smaller managable lattices sizes. Then with each iteration, the new (hopefully) faster program's results would be tested against the previous iteration.
